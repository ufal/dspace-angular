/**
 * This module bundles the eager theme modules for all available themes.
 * Eager modules contain components that are present on every page (to speed up initial loading)
 * and entry components (to ensure their decorators get picked up).
 *
 * Themes that aren't in use should not be imported here so they don't take up unnecessary space in the main bundle.
 *
 * NOTE: CustomEagerThemeModule is included to prevent the home-page flicker that occurs when
 * the active theme is `custom`. Without it, every themed wrapper (footer, header, root, ...) is
 * lazy-loaded via webpack code-splitting on the browser, leaving visible gaps after the SSR DOM
 * is torn down and before the CSR DOM is materialised.
